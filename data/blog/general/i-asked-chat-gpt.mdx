summary: I asked chatGPT to make me a blog post.

So I've been playing with chatGPT ever since it got released and I love to just check how good it can perform on various
areas. People writing content with blogs is not new. There are millions of subpar tabloids that do this all the time.
There are even useless tech sites that do this all the time which has no real use or doesn't solve any problem. Most of
which actually have wrong information.

Since I started the blog again, I want to see if it can make some cheap free content for me to populate the blog.
So I asked it to give me a blog post on promises and async...await. After some to and fros and some more pointers to
make it sound more like me, I finally was satisfied with a decent, mediocre post. I know this is low key to actually
post this, but I just want to share this to show how useful chatGPT can be. Maybe whatever it gives is not to be taken
as-is but it surely gives you a good starting point for your work from which you can build and add value to your
content.

So here's the post chatGPT wrote: [Promises in Javascript](/blog/js/promises)
