summary: My gazillionth time to start and maintain a blog
---

So another year, another blog. I'm pretty sure I won't maintain this one too. I'm not even sure who will read a blog in 2023. I'm mostly hoping to fill this with tech stuff so atleast someone from my tech circle will read it but who knows? maybe someone will find these interesting.
That is pretty much for this post. I don't want to deploy this blog to vercel and make it look empty. So just filling up some random stuff so that it looks like there is actual content.
